## 💡 What Is a Triggerbot in Team Fortress 2?

A **triggerbot** is a cheat tool that detects when your crosshair is hovering over a valid enemy hitbox and then fires your weapon automatically. Unlike aimbot, it doesn’t move your crosshair—it just guarantees you **shoot the second you’re locked in**.

It’s a favorite for **legit-looking playstyles**, especially in **Sniper vs Sniper** matchups or when **Spy needs to clutch shots fast**.
